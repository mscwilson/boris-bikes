##Boris Bikes Challenge

The main cycle hire scheme in London is commonly known as "Boris Bikes", after Boris Johnson who was mayor when the scheme opened (it wasn't actually his idea). In this repo, we were challenged to create a bike hire system as a way to learn TDD.

The Bike objects are stored in DockingStations. Users can take bikes out if one is available, dock bikes, report broken bikes (which can't then be released), and the docking stations have a set capacity.

The majority of this repo was written using pair programming. The contributors were: [PetarSimonovic](https://github.com/PetarSimonovic) and [Reeshul](https://github.com/Reeshul), [Reeshul](https://github.com/Reeshul) and [HamishArro](https://github.com/HamishArro), [HamishArro](https://github.com/HamishArro) and me, and then just me for the last few commits.
